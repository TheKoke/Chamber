**Chamber** â€” Desktop application for represent and calculate the model of how the beam of particles scatters in the scattering chamber.

First release is stable and you can get in on **[here](https://github.com/TheKoke/Chamber/releases/tag/v1.0)**.

At that time I'm [(**TheKoke**)](https://github.com/TheKoke) refactoring all repository, and soon I release the second version of this program.
